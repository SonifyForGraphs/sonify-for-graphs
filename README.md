install instructions to get set up (mac)

1. cd into the folder
2. python3 -m venv venv
3. source venv/bin/activate
4. npm install
5. npm run dev
6. go to localhost:3000 in browser

Windows might be different (possibly just python instead of python3 for the command line), but the main idea is to create a Python virtual environment in the folder, start it up, install all the node modules via npm, then start the project in development mode.
