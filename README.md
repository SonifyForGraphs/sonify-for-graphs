install instructions to get set up (mac)

1. cd into the folder
2. python3 -m venv venv
3. source venv/bin/activate
4. npm install
5. npm run dev
6. go to localhost:3000 in browser


Windows:
1. Install the latest version of python3 on the microsoft store. Be sure you install from here else the installation will fail.
2. cd into the folder
3. python -m venv venv
4. cd venv/Scripts/
5. ./activate
6. cd back to main folder
7. npm install
8. create .env.local file in folder
9. Add the env contents to this file and save
10. npm run dev
11. go to localhost:3000 in browser


Windows might be different (possibly just python instead of python3 for the command line), but the main idea is to create a Python virtual environment in the folder, start it up, install all the node modules via npm, then start the project in development mode.
