install instructions to get set up (mac)

1. cd into the folder
2. python3 -m venv venv
3. source venv/bin/activate
4. npm install
5. npm run dev
6. go to localhost:3000 in browser


Windows:
1. Install the latest version of python3 on the microsoft store. Be sure you install from here else the installation will fail.
2. cd into the folder
3. python -m venv venv
4. cd venv/Scripts/
5. ./activate
6. cd back to main folder
7. npm install
8. create .env.local file in folder
9. Add the env contents to this file and save
10. npm run dev
11. go to localhost:3000 in browser


Windows might be different (possibly just python instead of python3 for the command line), but the main idea is to create a Python virtual environment in the folder, start it up, install all the node modules via npm, then start the project in development mode.

-- Developer Setup Guide

Prerequisites:
Node.js: Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js installed. You can download it from the official website.

Python 3: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from the official website.

Surge (optional, for deployment): If the project is deployed using Surge, install it globally: npm install -g surge
For more details, refer to the [Surge Installation Guide](https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge).

Installation Instructions
Mac Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project folder: git clone https://github.com/SonifyForGraphs/sonify-for-graphs.git
cd sonify-for-graphs
2. Create a Python virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv
3. Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate
4. Install Node.js dependencies: npm install
5. Start the development server: npm run dev
6. Open the application in your browser: Navigate to http://localhost:3000

Windows Installation Steps
1. Install the latest version of Python 3 from the Microsoft Store: Ensure you install from this link to prevent installation issues.
2. Clone the repository and navigate into the folder: git clone https://github.com/SonifyForGraphs/sonify-for-graphs.git
cd sonify-for-graphs
3. Create a Python virtual environment: python -m venv venv
4. Activate the virtual environment: cd venv/Scripts/
./activate
cd ../../  # Move back to the main folder
5. Install Node.js dependencies: npm install
6. Create an environment file:
- Inside the project folder, create a new file called .env.local
- Add the required environment variables to this file and save it.
7. Start the development server: npm run dev
8. Open the application in your browser: Navigate to http://localhost:3000

Deployment Instructions
If the project is being deployed manually (instead of using Vercel's automatic deployment), follow these steps:

1. Ensure all environment variables are correctly configured.
2. Build the project for production: npm run build
3. Deploy to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Surge, or VPS).
   
For Vercel:
Run: vercel deploy
- Follow the deployment instructions in the terminal.

For Surge (if applicable):
Deploy using Surge with: surge
If you haven’t set up Surge,refer to the [Surge Deployment Guide](https://surge.sh/help/deploying-projects-on-surge).


Additional Notes
Common Issues:
If npm install fails, try running:
 npm cache clean --force
 npm install
If Python virtual environment activation fails, use:
 source venv/bin/activate
on macOS/Linux or:
 venv\Scripts\activate
on Windows.
Updating Dependencies:
To ensure your dependencies are up to date, run:
 npm update
